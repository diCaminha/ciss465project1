Calculate maze on server
Every time a row of blocks jumps back send a signal to the client to tell client where the maze should be.

Calculate input for server on server side. Calculate input for client on client side.
Send server ship position to client. Send client ship position to server.
Calculate if server ship dies on server side. Calculate if client dies on client side.

In sum, the only information that is sent is maze position from server to client, and ship position from server to client and from client to server.
